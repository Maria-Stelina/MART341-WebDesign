- This was my favorite project I've done in this class, as well as it being the most challenging. I tried very hard to make sure the coding was correct so that it could precisely fulfill my vision. While I was so focused on the visual aspect, I forgot to code in media queries as I went along with the project. I tried to add the queries at the very end, once I had all the other features blotted in, but it was too late. 

- I wanted to add a furniture project, but I never got the time to do it. 

- One thing I really struggled with this past semester was adding dropdowns. I spent two hours trying to add a dropdown on the DIY tab in the menu bar, but nothing worked. If anything, this motivated me to practice a lot of coding this summer.
