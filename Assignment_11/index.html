            I come from a heritedge of thriftiness. Being an Eastern European in America, I often hear the conceptions that Eastern Europeans have an affinity for "expensive things." The truth is we get crafty and find cheaper alternatives to "look good." The nice cars we drive? We usually buy broken cars from the auction and fix them ourselves 'till they look good as new (Who needs mechanics when your uncles and cousins live nearby?). The fancy outfits we wear? We usually get them from Ross or other thrift stores. Immigrant families had to get creative on how to improve their lives, so naturally I picked up on these innovative traits.

            With my knowledge gathered from over the years, I will show you several DIY crafts using careful instructions to upgrade your home and lifestyle without spending a fortune. Your wallet will thank you.

            It's time to channel that inner thrifty thumb of yours and make your home look like a "million bucks"!
