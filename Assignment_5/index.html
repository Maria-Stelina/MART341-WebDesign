        I think we've all had moments where a travesty shrouds us with a fog. It seems like there's no way out because the fog is too dense. Just because you can't see the pathway does not mean that it isn't there. This movie a reminder that with every ending comes a new beginning.

        This movie is based off of the real life author, Frances Mayes, who wrote an autobiography with the same name. The book documents the author's journey of buying a villa and living in the Italian countryside.
