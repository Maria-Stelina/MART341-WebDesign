                Artifical intelligence is currently one of the most debated topics today. Artists in particular are distraught because they fear A.I. generated artworks will replace them. A.I. is developing at such a rapid pace, most of us don't know the long term effects of it. It's possible that if things continue down this route, most human-run activities will eventually be replaced by A.I.

                No matter how much A.I evolves, there's one thing it will never have- A soul. I believe the soul is what makes humans intrinsically valuable and irreplacable. You can definitely see that human art has spirit behind it, whereas A.I. generated images seem... Lifeless.

                Does this mean we should get rid of A.I. entirely? Personally, I don't think so. While I don't agree with using A.I. to replace everything, I think we can use it as a tool to benefit or enhance our life. Oddly enough, A.I. came in handy for me. Lately I've been perpetually stuck in artblocks because there's a lot of stress going on in my life. I sometimes won't draw for weeks because the mental block is too strong. During the holidays I wanted to make a drawing based off of Tschaikovsky's piece, <b>"Dance of The Sugar Plum Fairy"</b> from <i>The Nutcracker</i>. I decided to type in some prompts on an A.I. image generator to get some inspiration for my artwork. The slew of vivid and colorful images instantly imbued me to draw. While we must be cautious about A.I., it can prove to be beneficial in some cases like artistic inspiration.
