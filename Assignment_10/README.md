- Universal selectors matches together elements of any type. They're useful for documents that contain multiple namespaces. An element tells the browser how to structure a certain part of an HTML document. CSS selectors finds HTML elements with a certain attribute. There's a few different selectors like class types and id types. The class types selects HTML elements with class attributes, and id types select the id attributes. To select an element with a class type, you have to type in a period, following the class name. With id selectors you would use a hashtag instead of a period.
